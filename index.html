                    <p1>This computer was given a database of over 30 of my chess games. It
                    studied my moves, quirks, and openings. I am new to chess and still
                    learning, so go easy one me... or at least this version of me.</p1>

                    <h1>Hello! Thanks for checking out my site</h1>
                    <p>I am a physics student with a deep passion and interest in Radio 
                        Frequency Engineering. Whether that is antenna design, signal 
                        processing, or developing simulation software similar to ANSYS HFSS
                        or CST studio. I work to build a theoretical foundation through 
                        coursework, research papers, and books. For practicality, I love 
                        doing projects and attending meetings to my local ham radio club.</p>

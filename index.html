        </h1>
        <p1>This computer was given a database of over 30 of my chess games. It
            studied my moves, quirks, and openings. I am new to chess and still
            learning, so go easy one me... or at least this version of me.</p1>
        <h1>Hello! Thanks for checking out my site</h1>
        <p>I am a physics student with a deep passion and interest in Radio 
            Frequency Engineering. Whether that is antenna design, signal 
            processing, or developing simulation software similar to ANSYS HFSS
            or CST studio. I work to build a theoretical foundation through 
            coursework, research papers, and books. For practicality, I love 
            doing projects and attending meetings to my local ham radio club.</p>
